                <p>I'm learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, which is essential for becoming a Web Developer. I'm
                    keeping up with my daily modules and tests. I spend almost 6 hours per day studying these topics in
                    depth.</p>

                <p>My vission is to finish all of the sessions and assessments on time, as well as learn more about the
                    topics covered in the courses through googling. I believe that at the end of the course, I will be
                    able to create a fully functional website.</p>

                <p>My ambition is to acquire all of the abilities required to work as a Full Stack Web Developer. After
                    four months, I'd like to see myself working as a Junior Web Developer in any company that pays well.
